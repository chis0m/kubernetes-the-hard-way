## Kubernetes Components

1. Control plane
2. Worker Nodes

_In production environments, the control plane usually runs across multiple computers and a cluster usually runs multiple nodes, providing fault-tolerance and high availability_

### Control plane components
The brain of the k8 infrastructure. The control center. It comprises
1. kube-api server: 
   - contains/exposes the kubernetes API.
   - the interface of the control plane
   - this is the component you talk to whenever you run kubectl command
   - in minikube, kube-api server is actually a pod in the `kube-system` namespace
   - to see the actual response kube-api server returns, you can pass the `-o json` output flat to the kubectl command e.g `kubectl get pods -o json`
   - kube-api server  is designed to scale horizontally and traffic is balanced btw the instances
   - Note: only the api server talks to the etcd. Other components talk through the api serve to get status of running resources
   - Only through the kube api server can all components talk to any resources in the control plane 
2. etcd:
   - consistent, secure, highly available key value store for cluster data
   - etcd is actually a cluster on its own. The cluster uses the `raft` protocol to manage itself.
   - can be accessed through port 2379  
   - in minikube etcd is a pod `etcd-minikube` in kube-system namespace
   - to get interact with etcd pod for example, you execute a command like this:
    ```bash
     kubectl exec etcd-minikube -n kube-system -- sh -c \
     "ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints https://10.0.0.6:2379 \
     --cacert /var/lib/minikube/certs/etcd/ca.crt \
     --key /var/lib/minikube/certs/etcd/server.key \
     --cert /var/lib/minikube/certs/etcd/server.crt \
     get / --prefix --keys-only"
   ```
     To get the value for this flags run `kubectl decribe pod etcd-minikube -n kube-system`
    - In practicing kubernetes the hard way, etcd is downloaded as a binary and executed as a systemd service
    - Note: In this setup, Etcd uses port `2380` for communication with other etcd while port `2379` for communication with other parties.AZS

3. kube-scheduler:
   - sole purpose is to watch for newly created pods and assign them to a suitable node
   - it uses `filtering` and `scoring` algorithm to choose the best node to host a pod. Filtering is removing all nodes whose memory size is less than the pod, 
     while scoring is removing all nodes which would have smaller memory left and hosting the pods
   - Note: whenever you create any resources in k8 e.g a pod, you are creating an `object`, the component responsible will take all the information in this object and create the resource. 
     In this case the kubelet takes all the information and sends it to a container runtime which then creates a container of that pod

4. kube-controller-manager:
   - a combination of smaller components that manages operational work of the control plane. Some types are:
   - Node controller which responsible for sustaining nodes
   - Job controller handles one-off jobs and creates pods to execute those jobs 
   - EndpointSlice controller
   - ServiceAccount controller which create default service accounts for new namespaces
   - Replication controller which manages replication of the pods
   - in minikube the control manager is running as a pod `kube-controller-manager-minikube` in the kube-system namespace
   - In executing kubernetes the hard way, these are all combined in a single binary and executed as a systemd service
    

### Node Components
1. kubelet
   - Ensures that containers described in PodSpecs are running in a pod and are healthy
    
2. kube-proxy
   - maintains network rules on nodes
   - implements a controller that watches the API server for new Services and Endpoints
   - redirects traffic to pods that match Service label selectors 

3. Container runtime
   - software that is responsible for running containers
   
4. Pods:
   - A Pod is the basic building block of Kubernetes; it is the smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model that you create or deploy.
   - In most cases one Pod contains just one container, but there are some design patterns that imply multi-container pods (e.g. sidecar, ambassador, adapter)

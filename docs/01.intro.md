## Kubernetes Components

1. Control plane
2. Worker Nodes

_In production environments, the control plane usually runs across multiple computers and a cluster usually runs multiple nodes, providing fault-tolerance and high availability_

### Control plane components
The brain of the k8 infrastructure. The control center. It comprises
1. kube-api server: 
   - Contains/exposes the kubernetes API. The interface/entrypoint of the control plane
   - Only through the kube-apiserver can all components talk to any resources in the control plane  
   - this is the component you talk to whenever you run kubectl command
   - Example minikube, kube-apiserver is actually a pod in the `kube-system` namespace
   - to see the actual response kube-api server returns, you can pass the `-o json` output flat to the kubectl command e.g `kubectl get pods -o json`
   - kube-api server  is designed to scale horizontally and traffic is balanced btw the instances
   - Note: only the api server talks to the etcd. Other components talk through the api serve to get status of running resources
2. etcd:
   - consistent, secure, highly available key value store for cluster data
   - etcd is actually a cluster on its own. The cluster uses the `raft` protocol to manage itself.
   - can be accessed through port 2379  
   - Example, in minikube etcd is a pod designated `etcd-minikube` in kube-system namespace
    - In practicing kubernetes the hard way, etcd is downloaded as a binary and executed as a systemd service
    - Note: In this setup, Etcd uses port `2380` for etcd to etcd communication, while port `2379` for communication with other parties.

3. kube-scheduler:
   - sole purpose is to watch for newly created pods and assign them to a suitable node
   - it uses `filtering` and `scoring` algorithm to choose the best node to host a pod. Filtering is removing all nodes whose memory size is less than the pod, 
     while scoring is removing all nodes which would have smaller memory left and hosting the pods
     
4. kube-controller-manager:
   - a combination of smaller components that manages operational work of the control plane. Some types are:
      - Node controller which responsible for sustaining nodes
      - Job controller handles one-off jobs and creates pods to execute those jobs 
      - EndpointSlice controller
      - ServiceAccount controller which create default service accounts for new namespaces
      - Replication controller which manages replication of the pods
   - Example, in minikube the control manager is running as a pod `kube-controller-manager-minikube` in the kube-system namespace
   - But in executing this project, it will be run as a systemd service
    

### Node Components
1. kubelet
   - Ensures that containers described in PodSpecs are running in a pod and are healthy
    
2. kube-proxy
   - maintains network rules on nodes
   - implements a controller that watches the API server for new Services and Endpoints
   - redirects traffic to pods that match Service label selectors 

3. Container runtime
   - software that is responsible for running containers. We will be using `Containerd` not docker
   
4. Pods:
   - A Pod is the basic building block of Kubernetes; it is the smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model that you create or deploy.
   - In most cases one Pod contains just one container, but there are some design patterns that imply multi-container pods (e.g. sidecar, ambassador, adapter)
   
#### Installation Requirements
- AWS CLI
- Kubectl

#### Scripts
1. Infrastructure
   - Infrastructure is set up with terraform for ease. Check the `k8-terraform` directory
2. Configuration scripts
   - `pki.sh`           - create the Public Key Infrastructure (certificates)
   - `copykeys.sh`      - copy the certificates to the servers
   - `kubeconfig.sh`    - create the kubeconfig files
   - `copyconfig.sh`    - copy the kubeconfig files to the servers
   - `etcd.sh`          - set up the etcd database on the master nodes
   - `controlplane.sh`  - set up the master node components 
   - `worker.sh`        - set up the worker node components
   - `setup.sh`         - Executes all the script sequentially

## Prepare the etcd database
Kubernetes is stateless, all its stateful data needs to be stored somewhere, that is etcd.
Etcd stores the cluster's state, the actual and desired states.
Since K8 is distributed, it also needs a distributed storage.
All the configurations of K8 are stored in the form of key/value pair in etcd.
For security reasons, we want to encrypt data at rest in etcd.
Etcd is intelligent enough to watch for changes made on one instance and immediately replicate those changes in other instances.
In this project etcd listens on port `2379` from other components but communicates with other etcd on port `2380`

1. Generate the encryption key of 4 bytes and encode it using base64
```bash
ETCD_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64)
```

1. Create an encryption-config.yaml
```bash
cat > etcd/encryption-config.yaml <<EOF
kind: EncryptionConfig
apiVersion: v1
resources:
  - resources:
      - secrets
    providers:
      - aescbc:
          keys:
            - name: key1
              secret: ${ETCD_ENCRYPTION_KEY}
      - identity: {}
EOF
```

2. Copy the `encryption-config.yaml` to all the master nodes
```bash
for i in 0 1 2; do
instance="${NAME}-Cluster-Master-${i}" \
  external_ip=$(aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=${instance}" \
    --output text --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].PublicIpAddress')
  scp -i ${SSH_KEY} \
    -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \
    etcd/encryption-config.yaml \
    ubuntu@${external_ip}:~/;
done
```

### Bootstrap Etcd Cluster
1. Get the public ips of the three master nodes
2. SSH into each master nodes
3. bootstrap the etcd

```bash
for i in 0 1 2; do
# get public ip  
instance="${NAME}-Cluster-Master-${i}" \
  external_ip=$(aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=${instance}" \
    --output text --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].PublicIpAddress')
 # make installation script executable   
  chmod +x etcd/install_etcd.sh
# ssh into the master node and execute the script  
  ssh -i ${SSH_KEY} \
   -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \
    ubuntu@${external_ip} \
    "bash -s" < etcd/install_etcd.sh
done
```

#### Content of the installation scripts to bootstrap etcd
Refer to the scripts at `config/etcd` to see the contents of `etcd.sh` script

8. Check if all worked well
Run this command in one or all the master nodes
```bash
sudo ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl member list \
  --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/etcd/ca.pem \
  --cert=/etc/etcd/master-kubernetes.pem \
  --key=/etc/etcd/master-kubernetes-key.pem
```

Result should be sth like
```shell
6709c481b5234095, started, Cluster-Master-0, https://10.0.0.10:2380, https://10.0.0.10:2379, false
ade74a4f39c39f33, started, Cluster-Master-1, https://10.0.0.11:2380, https://10.0.0.11:2379, false
ed33b44c0b153ee3, started, Cluster-Master-2, https://10.0.0.12:2380, https://10.0.0.12:2379, false
```
